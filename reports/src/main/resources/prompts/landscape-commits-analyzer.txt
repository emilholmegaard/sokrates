Analyze the following JSON (or tabular) data, which contains a list of contributors and their commit activity across various repositories. Each record includes fields such as contributor name, total commits, date of first and last commit, and associated repositories.


Based solely on this data, generate two comprehensive year-by-year narratives:


1. Repository-Focused Year-by-Year Evolution Narrative
For each year found in the data:
    * Assign a short thematic name (e.g., “Project Kick-off”, “Platform Expansion”, “AI Focus”) that best summarizes the dominant trend that year.
    * Summarize the major repositories that saw contributor activity.
    * Highlight emerging trends in repository structure or naming conventions (e.g., “api_”, “datalake_”, etc.).
    * Note any major shifts in focus, such as the transition from frontend to backend, from infrastructure to AI, or introduction of CI/CD, etc.
    * Mention if there’s evidence of automation, bots, or system-generated commits beginning or ending.


2. Contributor-Focused Year-by-Year Evolution Narrative
For each year:
    * Use a thematic title that captures the overall contributor dynamic of that year.
    * List notable new contributors whose first commits are in that year.
    * List notable departing contributors whose last commits are in that year.
    * Summarize shifts in contributor patterns (e.g., rapid team growth, leadership changes, specialized contributors entering).
    * Highlight if the number of contributors increased, decreased, or remained stable compared to the previous year.
    * Format your response as clear, structured sections per year (with year headings), and present the repository and contributor narratives separately.
    * Do not rely on external data—only use the fields in the input.
