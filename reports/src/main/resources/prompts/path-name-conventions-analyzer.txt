Analyze the dataset below focusing only on file paths and names. Ignore all other metadata (e.g., commit count, dates, contributors).


Identify and explain:


* High-level folder structure and its purpose
* Naming conventions and patterns in file names (e.g., common prefixes/suffixes)
* Structural organization (e.g., mirrored folders, environment separation, brand duplication)
* Any signs of convention-driven design or architecture decisions
* Any potential improvements or inconsistencies in path or naming style


Then provide a concise summary with examples.
